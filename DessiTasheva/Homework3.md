###### Repository Perspective

The Repository perspective gives access to the raw structure of the Dirigible instance.  It is comprised of the following views:
*	Repository
*	Snapshot
*	Preview 
*	Console 

There the user can inspect at low level the project and folder structure, as well as the artifacts content. The user is able to import/export snapshots via the Snapshot view.

**Caution**: Editing of the file contents via the Repository perspective is not recommended as it can lead to inconsistencies!
