**Workbench perspective**

**Workbench perspective** is the place where the user develops the
dynamic applications. This perspective contains all views and editors
that may help in the overall implementation, from domain models via
services to the user interface.

**The Workbench perspective is comprised of Workspace, Import,
Properties, Console and Preview views, plus the editors registered for
each file type. In other words, the minimal toolset for file management,
preview and editing operations.**

The main view opened by default in this perspective is the **Workspace**
explorer, a *standard view* on the projects in your *workspace*.

The **Workspace** is the place where developer creates and manages the
application artifacts. The first-level citizens of the *workspace* are
the *projects*. Each project can contain multiple folders and files
(artifacts).

A single user can have *multiple workspaces*, containing different set
of projects.

The artifacts i.e. the project management, can be done via the views and
editors in the **Workbench Perspective**.

**Import**

The **Import view** enables the user to upload a \*.zip file, containing
one or more projects, to the selected Workspace. The view includes a
progress bar for navigation of the process. The user can manage and
switch between multiple workspaces through the **Workspace** menu.

of the code that you are executing.
